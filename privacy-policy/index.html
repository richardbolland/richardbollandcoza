    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 12, 2026</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Richard Bolland ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you play the game <strong>Long Jump</strong> (including versions hosted on CrazyGames) or visit our website.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection Transparency</h2>
    <p>We collect specific types of data to ensure the game functions correctly, to improve user experience, and to monetize the game via advertisements. We collect this data from the following sources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> When you play, we (or our third-party partners) may collect your IP address, device information (device ID, model, operating system), and gameplay usage data (session duration, game progress).</li>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Data:</strong> If you voluntarily provide it, we collect your username, email address (for support), or in-game chat messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> If you make in-game purchases, transaction data is collected by our payment processors; we do not store your financial details directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Purpose of Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect and use this data for the following specific purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Functionality:</strong> To save your progress and preferences locally or in the cloud.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To understand player behavior and improve game mechanics.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization & Ads:</strong> To serve relevant advertisements and personalize content.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> To respond to your inquiries and fix technical issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We may share data with trusted third-party partners to operate the game. These partners adhere to their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CrazyGames:</strong> We share anonymized usage data with CrazyGames to facilitate hosting and platform analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Networks:</strong> We work with ad networks (such as AdMob or similar providers compatible with the platform) to display ads. These networks may collect data to provide personalized advertising.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> Transactions are handled by third-party payment providers (such as PayPal or platform-specific processors).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. While we strive to protect your information, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>5. User Consent</h2>
    <p>By playing Long Jump, you consent to the data collection practices described in this policy. For data collection beyond basic functionality (such as personalized ads or sensitive data), we will obtain explicit consent via in-game notices or consent management tools where required by law.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
    <p>Long Jump complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent. If the game is targeted at children, we ensure that all advertisements and data collection practices are compliant with COPPA regulations (e.g., serving non-personalized ads).</p>

    <h2>7. Developer Portal & Platform Rules</h2>
    <p>In compliance with platform developer agreements (including CrazyGames):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Scraping:</strong> We strictly prohibit the use of automated tools to scrape or collect user data from the platform.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> If the game features chat or usernames, we employ filters and monitoring to ensure content compliance and user safety. We accept liability for ensuring this content adheres to platform standards.</li>
    </ul>
