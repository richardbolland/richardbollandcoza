    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 12, 2026</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Richard Bolland ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you play the game <strong>Long Jump</strong> (available at longjump.co.za) or visit our website.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We believe in privacy by default. We collect minimal data necessary to make the game function and improve your experience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Data (Local Storage):</strong> We use local storage on your device to save your game progress, daily scores, and settings. This data stays on your device and is not sent to our servers unless you choose to share your score.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> If you choose to enter a name or alias for the leaderboard or game interface, this information is stored locally and may be processed to display your score.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may use standard web analytics tools to understand how players interact with the game (e.g., number of visitors, session duration). This data is anonymized and aggregated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the game functionality (e.g., remembering your daily progress).</li>
        <li>To improve the game experience based on aggregated usage trends.</li>
        <li>To display your chosen username within the game environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
    <p>Long Jump uses "Local Storage" technology (similar to cookies) to save your progress on your specific device. By playing the game, you consent to the use of this local storage for essential game functionality.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services for specific functions, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Our website is hosted by a third-party provider which may collect standard server logs (IP addresses, request times) for security and maintenance purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Payments/Tips:</strong> If you choose to support us via a "Tip Jar" or donation link, your payment is processed securely by a third-party payment processor. We do not store or have access to your financial information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Long Jump is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date."</p>
